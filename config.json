    "bio": "I am a Software Engineer specializing in backend and full-stack development, with experience building distributed, event-driven systems. Currently at Verse Innovation, I work on scalable log ingestion pipelines, API performance optimization, and GenAI-powered workflows like Natural Language to SQL systems used in production. I enjoy owning features end-to-end — from API design and data pipelines to debugging and performance tuning in production. With a strong foundation in data structures and systems, I’m passionate about building reliable backend platforms that scale and solve real business problems.",
